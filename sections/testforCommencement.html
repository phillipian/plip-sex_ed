<p><span>S</span>tart to finish, it takes around nine minutes to walk from the pock-marked metal door of The
Phillipian newsroom in the basement of Morse to the front steps of Taylor Hall in West Quad South. I almost never varied my route when I made the walk alone.</p>

<p>Right turn from the newsroom, up the stairs and out the white-washed doors that are just
waiting to fall off their hinges when a rushing Editor (cough cough) slams them open one too many times. Diagonal across Flagstaff Court and under the Great Oak by the Library and clockwise (always clockwise, even if it takes a few extra steps) around the Bell Tower. Straight shot across Main Street on the world's most dangerous crosswalk, between Adams and Bishop, slight left towards Taylor. I took that walk enough times that I could make the trip blindfolded.</p>
<hr><p><i>"At the right time of night, nothing is moving. The animals are sleeping or still awake preparing themselves for the next day. And, of course, there isn't any wildlife. A couple of lights might peek through some dorm windows or up from basements, messengers from students who only wish they could go to bed."</i></p>
<hr>
<p>The trip between Taylor and the newsroom returns me to my favorite oasis on Andover
Hill. There's nothing special about the path I took, in itself-anyone could do it, if they knew
where they were headed. At 1 a.m. (or often later...sorry Mr. Murphy), the walk is something that none who have not experienced it can understand.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is a constant, slow sheet of snow drifting down, sometimes a warm or
cool wind, sometimes heavy rain or sometimes only a too-thick layer of dirty white-brown
bordering the paths. Campus is bereft of its backpack bearing wound-up students and devoid of cars and trucks clogging up Main Street or Salem Street by the Bell Tower. At the right time of night, nothing is moving. The animals are sleeping or still awake preparing themselves for the next day. And, of course, there isn't any wildlife. A couple of lights might peek through some dorm windows or up from basements, messengers from students who only wish they could go to bed.</p>

<p>PAPS comes around sometimes, reminding me that other people exist on this campus at
this time of night. The blue Ford Escape that sometimes followed me back to the Quads (Yes, it was creepy. Really.) was an unwelcome interruption. It was stealing my favorite moments of Andover away from me, running off with the precious, uncorrupted, untouchable silence that only Andover Hill in the middle of the night can provide.</p>

<p>That silence is unparalleled. It left me alone with my thoughts in a way that I have never
elsewhere experienced, because the silence was not only just an absence of sound. It was a time to be alone, to strain as hard as I could to pinpoint the shape of aural void around me, to feel the energy of Andover expressed in the ultimate absence of activity.</p>

<p>If freshman fall Sam Green had walked from the rooms in the basement of Morse to the
steps of Taylor Hall in the middle of the night, he wouldn't have appreciated this silence as I have. He is better remembered for speaking 29 times in a single English class, as Mr. Bardo immortalized in his Fall Term Instructor report. Ninth grade Sam was good at talking but only ok at expressing meaningful ideas. He was good at listening to himself and very bad at even hearing others.</p>

<p>For many nights at the beginning of my year and change at <i>The Phillipian</i>, I jumped on a
rickety bicycle and sped back to Taylor as quickly as I could. The bike's frantically spinning gears were more than enough to devour the silence, to mask the beauty that I, an over-tired and over-motivated rider, was rushing past. I didn't even know what I had been missing.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, Andover persuaded me to stop riding my bike. I didn't have the
will within me to steer those loose handlebars across campus, and the pedals had started to fall off, so I just got off and walked.</p>

<p>I started to appreciate the power and grace of the night through which I was passing.
For what its worth, I know now what you couldn't have convinced me of fours years ago as
I drove towards the Bell Tower and "smart people Latin" and the boathouse and the newsroom and Tucker House and Taylor Hall and immaturity and a slow trek through a bright and dark night.</p>

<p>The fastest way to do something is often not the best.</p></div>
