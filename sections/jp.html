		  <h1>Thank You `13</h1>
          <h2>By John Palfrey</h2>
          <h3>Head of School</h3>
          <div id="content_text">
<p><span>I</span>t has been such a privilege to serve as your head of school this year.  As I think back on our year together - my "junior" year at Andover - I am struck by how many people I'm grateful to and how welcoming you have been as a community.  I love the "Hi, Mr. Palfrey!" greetings on the pathways and your emails, tweets, and other forms of creative communications.  (I do worry a little about what happens with stealth photos on Instagram and SnapChat, but that's another story.)  Your engagement in the life of the community, and in my own life, makes coming to work fun and rewarding, every day.</p>

<p>As I think about this year, I also find it striking to consider the number of big events that have occurred and the changes that are underway.  The positive changes on campus almost all have to do with conversations where you, as students, have led the way - either directly or indirectly.</p>

<hr><p><i>"I end this first year as your head of school with an acute sense of humility: realizing how little I know and how much I have to learn to be an effective head of school."</i></p>
<hr>
<p>For instance, we are in the midst of a healthy, open, serious discussion about gender diversity and the future of co-education.  The prompting for this important discussion has come from a mix of students and adults, sustained over several months.  We have also focused, together, on the importance of our own role in protecting the planet.  The Divest Andover organization has prompted this discussion, picked up by Philo, the Phillipian and the Board of Trustees as an active, serious topic.</p>

<p>As a faculty, we have also spent the year reflecting on the kind of teaching and learning that take place on Andover hill.  You, the students, are the prompt for this conversation.  Your way of learning and interacting with one another, academically and socially, leads us to think deeply about which of our traditional modes of education we should preserve and which new approaches we might employ.  We are asking hard questions about the craft of teaching and learning and how we can improve what we do.</p>

<p>These several issues bring to mind what we are called to do at Andover.  These issues help us to see our place in the world. We have much to do that lies ahead of us - on issues of equity, the environment, and the future of teaching and learning, among many others.</p>

<p>Your activism and engagement reminds us, too, that we operate in a context much larger than our own campus.  This year, we reckoned together, as a community, with the horrors of what happened in a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school in December.  We grappled with what happened in Boston at the finish line of the marathon in April.  We remember, too, that extraordinarily upsetting things happen far from us and deserve our attention, such as the loss of more than 1,000 lives in a garment factory in Bangladesh as we wound down our academic year in May.</p>

<p>The way that we respond to these events, near and far, is a critically important part of our education at Andover.  You have responded to hardship and to sadness, on campus and off, with empathy, compassion, and grit.  You have demonstrated a strength and forcefulness of character that is central to the Andover experience.  As a student body, you demonstrate your care for one another and for the world at large.  We need to remember the importance of these characteristics, on sunny days as well as the stormy ones that are surely in our future.</p>

<p>We are a school of enormous privilege.  We have the luxury of time together, as a residential community, on a beautiful, well-conceived campus.  We have an unbelievably devoted group of teachers on campus, talented staff, and an unthinkably wonderful, diverse student body.  We have the accumulated wisdom of 235 years of effective instruction at two schools - Phillips Academy and Abbot Academy - on which to draw.  We have parents, alumni, and friends who contribute millions of dollars each year to enable us to be a need-blind school that offers an extraordinary education to students from around the world.  We have much for which to be thankful. I am eager to build on what I've learned in the past eleven months.</p>

<p>I end this first year as your head of school with an acute sense of humility: realizing how little I know and how much I have to learn to be an effective head of school.  It is a great privilege to follow the lead of my predecessor, Barbara Landis Chase.  It is fun and rewarding to serve alongside people who have been at this work as long as I've been alive, especially Associate Head of School Rebecca Sykes, whose wisdom, it seems to me, knows no bounds.  I will miss the energy, enthusiasm, and devotion of the seniors who are graduating this June.  I will miss working with the faculty members who are leaving this year, and greatly look forward to learning from and serving alongside those who are coming back in the fall.  </p>

<p>We all, myself included, have great teachers here at Phillips Academy.  I count myself among those who are fortunate to be receiving an Andover education.  I look forward to making the most of it.</p>

<p>The fastest way to do something is often not the best.</p></div></div>
